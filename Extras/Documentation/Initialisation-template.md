Before using the engine, you need to start it up and install the log handlers that you're going to use.

This doesn't require much code. A typical place to do it would be at the top of applicationWillFinishLaunching, before doing anything else:

```
// initialise log manager
ECLogManager* lm = [ECLogManager sharedInstance];
[lm startup];

// install some handlers
[lm registerHandler:[[[ECLogHandlerNSLog alloc] init] autorelease]];
[lm registerHandler:[[[ECLogHandlerFile alloc] init] autorelease]];
```

You should also shut the log manager down before terminating. This ensures that it gets a chance to save out any settings changes you've made. On the mac, you might put this in applicationWillTerminate:

```
[[ECLogManager sharedInstance] shutdown];
```

Finally, it's not a bad idea to explicitly save the settings when your application goes into the background - just in case it gets abruptly terminated by something. For example, in applicationWillResignActive you might do:

```
[[ECLogManager sharedInstance] saveChannelSettings];
```

This will ensure that your current setup is restored next time.
