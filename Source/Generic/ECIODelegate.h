/**
 Defines an abstract IO API for doing two things:
 
 - reading settings
 - outputting structured information
 
 The settings are of a form that might be supplied in a dictionary, via a command line interface, or from some other key/value store.
 
 The output of information is structured in the sense that it can be nested by opening and closing groups. The intention here is to allow a tool to produce human readable output but also to have enough context to optionally produce machine-readable output instead.
 
 The protocol provides explicit methods for outputting formatted strings and errors, but also for outputting arbitrary "information" associated with a key. These can just be objects of any type.
 
 A naive tool that supports this protocol can choose to log out all information in a flat way. By supporting keys and grouping, however, the API also allows a tool to create meaningful output that is more structured - eg JSON or XML.
