/**
 Variant of description, which maintains some structure.
 Called on a normal object, it returns the same as description.
 Called on an NSDictionary it returns a dictionary containing the result of descriptionDictionary for each key.
 Called on an NSArray it returns an array containing the result of descriptionDictionary for each item.

 It lets you get a structured description of a collection which you can then compare with another, without worrying
 about the order that the keys appear in.
