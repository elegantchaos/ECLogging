/**
 * Handler which logs to disk.
 *
 * Log files are created in `~/Library/Logs/app-id`, so if you have a
 * channel called "Fred" in an application with the id "com.elegantchaos.test",
 * and you configure it to use this handler, any output will be written to the file
 * `~/Library/Logs/com.elegantchaos.test/Fred.log".
 *
 * Each logged message is appended to the file on a new line (messages that
 * span multiple lines are logged unmodified, so you can't necessarily rely
 * on there being a one-to-one mapping between lines and messages.
 *
 * Contextual information for a message (such as the file that generated it) is
 * appended to the end of the line, inside « and » characters.
 *
